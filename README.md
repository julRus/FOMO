To start the app you will need either android studio or Expo. I recommend using Expo as it is quicker to set up, takes less space and easier to use. Download the expo app onto your phone and use it to scan the QR Code that will appear after tping npm install into your terminal and then typing npm start, ensure you are in this projects directory /FOMO/fomo.

When the app has started you may want to log in immedietly and may use the details(username and password) above to do so. If you wish to create an account, I recomend that when you get onto the Interests choice section choose LIVE as one of your options as some of the other options do not have any events happening right now or over the next few weeks therefor your list will be empty:

Ideal list for the most events:

1. Live
2. Theatre
3. Date
4. Comedy
